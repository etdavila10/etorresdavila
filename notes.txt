Some nice ideas to liven the website:
* Create a toggle on the welcome component which switches between mathematics and software.
  * The math toggle will show the mathematics component and teaching
  * The software toggle will show the software component. A page doesn't have to be filled out.
* More visuals over words. This is what the better portfolios have in common.
